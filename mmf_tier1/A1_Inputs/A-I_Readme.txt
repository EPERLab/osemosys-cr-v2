1) A-I_Classifier_Modes_Demand: defines the sectors, energy vectors per sector and level of complexity to model demand
2) A-I_Classifier_Modes_Supply: defines how each energy vector is produced and transformed
3) A-I_Classifier_Modes_Transport: structures the transport sector
4) A-I_Horizon_Configuration: has the system model period

These inputs are then entered into A_Model_Structure
